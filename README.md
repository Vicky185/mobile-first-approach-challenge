# Mobile-first-approach challenge

In this we had the challenge of a mobile-first approach using the combination of html5 and css. 

## Instructions as follows:

Using a mobile-first approach, make a webpage responsive in line with the following guidelines. In the hint tab, you'll find a link to boilerplate files to help get you started.

1. Make the div elements 30% of the window size. Now make this change only for the devices that are wider than or equal to 992pxet the margin to 10px on all sides for each column for the devices that are wider than or equal to 992px
2. Keep the full-size width for the devices below the 992px
3. Remove the left and right margin for the devices below the 992px
4. Remember to keep in mind the mobile-first approach

# Mistakes found:

* realised that unlike the example in the video, only needed one media query
* the mobile-first style was 100% of the size of the screen, ie would fill screen then when we created the query of 30% of the size for larger screen then we saw how it would change as the screen size increased
* need revision of stylistic characteristics, i.e. the colours we can use and also extra additions, e.g. border-radius


Reminded myself when doing this that i should play with this more!
